### The difference between `cross_validate()` and `cross_validate_fn()` {#diff-cv-fn}

Originally, `cvms` only provided the option to cross-validate Gaussian and binomial regression models, fitting
the models internally with the `lm()`, `lmer()`, `glm()`, and `glmer()` functions.
The `cross_validate()` function has thus been designed specifically to work with those functions.

To allow cross-validation of custom model functions like support-vector machines, neural networks, etc., 
the `cross_validate_fn()` function has been added. You provide a model function 
and (if defaults fail) a predict function, and it does the rest (see examples below).

# Examples {#examples}

## Attach packages {#packages}

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(cvms)
library(groupdata2) # fold() partition()
library(knitr) # kable()
library(dplyr) # %>% arrange()
library(ggplot2)
```

## Load data {#load-data}

The dataset `participant.scores` comes with cvms.

```{r}
data <- participant.scores
```

## Fold data {#fold}

Create a grouping factor for subsetting of folds using `groupdata2::fold()`. Order the dataset by the folds.

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(7)

# Fold data 
data <- fold(data, k = 4,
             cat_col = 'diagnosis',
             id_col = 'participant') %>% 
  arrange(.folds)

# Show first 15 rows of data
data %>% head(15) %>% kable()
```

## Cross-validate a single model {#cv-single}

### Gaussian {#cv-single-gaussian}

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
CV1 <- cross_validate(data, "score~diagnosis",
                      fold_cols = '.folds',
                      family = 'gaussian',
                      REML = FALSE)

# Show results
CV1

# Let's take a closer look at the different parts of the output 

# Results metrics
CV1 %>% select_metrics() %>% kable()

# Nested predictions 
# Note that [[1]] picks predictions for the first row
CV1$Predictions[[1]] %>% head() %>% kable()

# Nested results from the different folds
CV1$Results[[1]] %>% kable()

# Nested model coefficients
# Note that you have the full p-values, 
# but kable() only shows a certain number of digits
CV1$Coefficients[[1]] %>% kable()

# Additional information about the model
# and the training process
CV1 %>% select(11:17) %>% kable()

```

### Binomial {#cv-single-binomial}

```{r}
CV2 <- cross_validate(data, "diagnosis~score",
                      fold_cols = '.folds',
                      family = 'binomial')

# Show results
CV2

# Let's take a closer look at the different parts of the output 
# We won't repeat the parts too similar to those in Gaussian

# Results metrics
CV2 %>% select(1:9) %>% kable()
CV2 %>% select(10:14) %>% kable()

# ROC curve info
CV2$ROC[[1]] %>% head() %>% kable()

# Confusion matrix
CV2$`Confusion Matrix`[[1]] %>% kable()
```


## Cross-validate multiple models {#cv-multi}

### Create model formulas {#cv-multi-formulas}

```{r}
models <- c("score~diagnosis", "score~age")
mixed_models <- c("score~diagnosis+(1|session)", "score~age+(1|session)")
```

### Cross-validate fixed effects models {#cv-multi-fixed}

```{r}
CV3 <- cross_validate(data, models,
                      fold_cols = '.folds',
                      family = 'gaussian',
                      REML = FALSE)

# Show results
CV3
```

### Cross-validate mixed effects models {#cv-multi-mixed}

```{r}
CV4 <- cross_validate(data, mixed_models,
                      fold_cols = '.folds',
                      family = 'gaussian',
                      REML = FALSE)

# Show results
CV4
```

## Repeated cross-validation {#cv-repeated}

Let's first add some extra fold columns. We will use the num_fold_cols argument to add 3 unique fold columns. We tell `fold()` to keep the existing fold column and simply add three extra columns. We could also choose to remove the existing fold column, if for instance we were changing the number of folds (k). Note, that the original fold column will be renamed to ".folds_1".  

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(2)

# Fold data 
data <- fold(data, k = 4,
             cat_col = 'diagnosis',
             id_col = 'participant',
             num_fold_cols = 3,
             handle_existing_fold_cols = "keep")

# Show first 15 rows of data
data %>% head(10) %>% kable()

```


```{r}
CV5 <- cross_validate(data, "diagnosis ~ score",
                      fold_cols = paste0(".folds_", 1:4),
                      family = 'binomial',
                      REML = FALSE)

# Show results
CV5

# The binomial output now has a nested 'Results' tibble
# Let's see a subset of the columns
CV5$Results[[1]] %>% select(1:8) %>%  kable()
```

## Cross-validating custom model functions {#cv-custom}

`cross_validate_fn()` works with regression (`gaussian`), binary classification (`binomial`), and multiclass classification (`multinomial`). 

### SVM {#cv-custom-svm}

Let's cross-validate a support-vector machine using the `svm()` function from the `e1071` package.
First, we will create a model function. You can do anything you want in it, as long as it takes the arguments `train_data` and `formula` and returns the fitted model object.

```{r}
# Create model function
#
# train_data : tibble with the training data
# formula : a formula object

svm_model_fn <- function(train_data, formula){
  
  # Note that `formula` must be specified first
  # when calling svm(), otherwise it fails
  e1071::svm(formula = formula,
             data = train_data, 
             kernel = "linear",
             type = "C-classification")
}
```

For the `svm()` function, the default predict function and settings within `cross_validate_fn()` works, so we don't have to specify a predict function. In many cases, it's probably safer to supply a predict function anyway, so you're sure everything is correct. We will see how in the naive Bayes example below, but first, let's cross-validate the model function. Note, that some of the arguments have changed names (`models -> formulas`, `family -> type`).

```{r}
# Cross-validate svm_model_fn
CV6 <- cross_validate_fn(data = data,
                         model_fn = svm_model_fn,
                         formulas = c("diagnosis~score", "diagnosis~age"),
                         fold_cols = '.folds_1', 
                         type = 'binomial')

CV6
```

### Naive Bayes {#cv-custom-naive}

The naive Bayes classifier requires us to supply a predict function, so we will go through that next. First, let's create the model function.

```{r}
# Create model function
#
# train_data : tibble with the training data
# formula : a formula object

nb_model_fn <- function(train_data, formula){
  e1071::naiveBayes(formula = formula, 
                    data = train_data)
}
```

Now, we will create a predict function. This will usually wrap `stats::predict()` and just make sure, the predictions have the correct format. When `type` is `binomial`, the predictions should be a vector, or a one-column matrix / data frame, with the probabilities of the second class (alphabetically). That is, if we have the classes `0` and `1`, it should be the probabilities of the observations being in class `1`. The help file, `?cross_validate_fn`, describes the formats for the other types (`gaussian` and `multinomial`). 

The predict function should take the arguments `test_data`, `model`, and `formula`. You do not need to use the `formula` within your function.

```{r}
# Create predict function
#
# test_data : tibble with the test data
# model : fitted model object
# formula : a formula object
nb_predict_fn <- function(test_data, model, formula){
    stats::predict(object = model, newdata = test_data, 
                   type = "raw", allow.new.levels = TRUE)[,2]
  }
```

With both functions specified, we are ready to cross-validate our naive Bayes classifier.

```{r}
CV7 <- cross_validate_fn(data,
                         model_fn = nb_model_fn,
                         formulas = c("diagnosis~score", "diagnosis~age"),
                         type = 'binomial',
                         predict_fn = nb_predict_fn,
                         fold_cols = '.folds_1')

CV7
```


## Evaluating predictions {#evaluate}

Evaluate predictions from a model trained outside cvms. Works with regression (`gaussian`), binary classification (`binomial`), and multiclass classification (`multinomial`). The following is an example of multinomial evaluation.

### Multinomial {#evaluate-multinomial}

Create a dataset with 3 predictors and a target column. Partition it with `groupdata2::partition()` to create a training set and a validation set. `multiclass_probability_tibble()` is a simple helper function for generating random tibbles.

```{r}
# Set seed
set.seed(1)

# Create class names
class_names <- paste0("class_", 1:4)

# Create random dataset with 100 observations 
# Partition into training set (75%) and test set (25%)
multiclass_partitions <- multiclass_probability_tibble(
  num_classes = 3, # Here, number of predictors
  num_observations = 100,
  apply_softmax = FALSE,
  FUN = rnorm,
  class_name = "predictor_") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(class = sample(
    class_names,
    size = 100,
    replace = TRUE)) %>%
  partition(p = 0.75,
            cat_col = "class")

# Extract partitions
multiclass_train_set <- multiclass_partitions[[1]]
multiclass_test_set <- multiclass_partitions[[2]]

multiclass_test_set
```

Train multinomial model using the `nnet` package and get the predicted probabilities. 

```{r}
# Train multinomial model
multiclass_model <- nnet::multinom(
   "class ~ predictor_1 + predictor_2 + predictor_3",
   data = multiclass_train_set)

# Predict the targets in the test set
predictions <- predict(multiclass_model, 
                       multiclass_test_set,
                       type = "probs") %>%
  dplyr::as_tibble()

# Add the targets
predictions[["target"]] <- multiclass_test_set[["class"]]

head(predictions, 10)
```

Perform the evaluation. This will create one-vs-all binomial evaluations and summarize the results.

```{r}
# Evaluate predictions
ev <- evaluate(data = predictions,
               target_col = "target",
               prediction_cols = class_names,
               type = "multinomial")

ev
```

The class level results (i.e., the one-vs-all evaluations) are also included, and would usually be reported alongside the above results.

```{r}
ev$`Class Level Results`
```


## Baseline evaluations {#baseline}

Create baseline evaluations of a test set.

### Gaussian {#baseline-gaussian}

Approach: The baseline model (y ~ 1), where 1 is simply the intercept (i.e. mean of y), is fitted on n random subsets of the training set and evaluated on the test set. We also perform an evaluation of the model fitted on the entire training set.

Start by partitioning the dataset.

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Partition the dataset 
partitions <- groupdata2::partition(participant.scores,
                                    p = 0.7,
                                    cat_col = 'diagnosis',
                                    id_col = 'participant',
                                    list_out = TRUE)
train_set <- partitions[[1]]
test_set <- partitions[[2]]
```

Create the baseline evaluations:

```{r}
baseline(test_data = test_set, train_data = train_set,
         n = 100, dependent_col = "score", family = "gaussian")
```

### Binomial {#baseline-binomial}

Approach: n random sets of predictions are evaluated against the dependent variable in the test set. We also evaluate a set of all 0s and a set of all 1s.

Create the baseline evaluations:

```{r}
baseline(test_data = test_set, n = 100, 
         dependent_col = "diagnosis", family = "binomial")
```

### Multinomial {#baseline-multinomial}

Approach: Creates one-vs-all (binomial) baseline evaluations for n sets of random predictions against the dependent variable, along with sets of "all class x,y,z,..." predictions.

Create the baseline evaluations:

```{r}
multiclass_baseline <- baseline(
  test_data = multiclass_test_set, n = 100,
  dependent_col = "class", family = "multinomial")

# Summarized metrics
multiclass_baseline$summarized_metrics

# Summarized class level results for class 1
multiclass_baseline$summarized_class_level_results %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Class == "class_1") %>%
  tidyr::unnest(Results)

# Random evaluations
# Note, that the class level results for each repetition
# is available as well
multiclass_baseline$random_evaluations
```

## Plot results {#plot}

There are currently a small set of plots for quick visualization of the results. It is supposed to be easy to extract the needed information to create your own plots. If you lack access to any information or have other requests or ideas, feel free to open an issue.

### Gaussian {#plot-gaussian}

```{r}
cv_plot(CV1, type = "RMSE") +
  theme_bw()
cv_plot(CV1, type = "r2") +
  theme_bw()
cv_plot(CV1, type = "IC") +
  theme_bw()
cv_plot(CV1, type = "coefficients") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Binomial {#plot-binomial}

```{r}
cv_plot(CV2, type = "ROC") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Generate model formulas {#generate-formulas}

Instead of manually typing all possible model formulas for a set of fixed effects (including the possible interactions), `combine_predictors()` can do it for you (with some constraints). 

When including interactions, >200k formulas have been precomputed for up to 8 fixed effects, with a maximum interaction size of 3, and a maximum of 5 fixed effects per formula. It's possible to further limit the generated formulas.

We can also append a random effects structure to the generated formulas.

```{r}
combine_predictors(dependent = "y",
                   fixed_effects = c("a","b","c"),
                   random_effects = "(1|d)")
```

If two or more fixed effects should not be in the same formula, like an effect and its log-transformed version, we can provide them as sublists.

```{r}
combine_predictors(dependent = "y",
                   fixed_effects = list("a", list("b","log_b")),
                   random_effects = "(1|d)")
```
